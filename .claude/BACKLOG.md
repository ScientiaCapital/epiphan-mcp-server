## Strategic Moat Analysis

### Why Epiphan Leads with This

1. **First AI-Native AV Control**
   - No competitor has MCP + Vision AI for AV hardware
   - 12-18 month head start if launched now

2. **Unique Capabilities Only Epiphan Can Offer**
   - Scene understanding ("Is presenter in frame?")
   - Quality monitoring ("Lighting issues detected")
   - Text extraction ("Current slide: Q4 Results")
   - Change detection ("Slide advanced")

3. **Defensible Advantages**
   - Deep Pearl API integration
   - Training data from real production environments
   - Customer feedback loop

4. **Expansion Path**
   - Start with Pearl → Expand to other Epiphan products
   - Partner with LMS vendors (Panopto, Kaltura)
   - White-label for integrators

### Competitive Response Timeline
| Competitor | Likely Response Time |
|------------|---------------------|
| Crestron | 18-24 months |
| Extron | 18-24 months |
| Barco | 12-18 months |
| AJA | Never (different market) |
| Magewell | 12-18 months |

**Window of Opportunity: 12-18 months to establish dominance**
